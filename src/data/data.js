/*
 * Xylophobia - A Virtual Forest Experience
 * All models are compressed using Draco compression.
 * This file contains the data for the virtual forest, including tree models and their properties.
 * Each tree has a unique UUID, model path, title, description, position in the scene.
 * The data also includes environmental metrics like soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels.
 * This data is used to render the scene and provide information about each tree. Data will replaced with real data in the future.
 * The models are expected to be in the public directory of the React app.
